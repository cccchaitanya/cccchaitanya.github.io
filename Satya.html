<h1> Values From Vedas </h1>

<h2> Values Of Satya: </h2>
<p>In the Vedas and later sutras, the meaning of the word satya evolves into an ethical concept about truthfulness and is considered as an important virtue.
The word Satya is derived from Sat, which means 'being'.
As per vedas, nothing is or exists in reality except truth.
That is why Sat or Truth is perhaps the most important name of God.
Satya is also referred to as truthfulness.</p>
<h3> Satya provide us with values such as:</h3>
<ul type="circle"><Font color= white><b>
<li> Being true and consistent with reality in one's thought, speech, and action,
<li> The truth based on the common understanding of ordinary people.
</ul></font></ul>
