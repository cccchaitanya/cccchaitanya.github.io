<h2> Conclusion: </h2>
<p>We, as proud citizens of our nation, should enrich our culture and tradition by teaching our children about vedas and discipline.
Hundreds of years ago, our ancestors wrote ancient scripts to guide their future generations.
As their followers, it is our moral duty to cherish these vedas within us and shall not let these from being erased form the society.
We, at all means, should respect these vedic sculptures and shall live in prosperity and divine peace as wished by our ancestors.<br>

 Vyasa is the pivotal truth, the substratum, the very rock-foundation of the entire spring of the Indian culture based on the vedantic philosophy.<br>
